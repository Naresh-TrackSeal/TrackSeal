A. There are three files for WebApp publishing to Azure.
  1. Please extract all the files from three Zip files into one foler
  2. And then publish from that folder.

Please note that we are still having issue using Azure database. If you too, then use the other Connection string which points to our database in a Data Center hosted server.

B. BacPac file is for creating iTrackDatabase (Default database name is AssetTracking as used in connection string).
